=============================

GENERAL INFORMATION

MRS.pm provides the capibility to resolve the MCC (Mobile Country Code) and MNC (Mobile Network Code)
for a given MSISDN (Mobile Station International ISDN Number, see E.164) of a mobile subscriber. Based upon
information the service also delivers detailed data about the name of the home operator, country, timezone
and other data.

Also additional information about the on/offline status of the mobile subscriber and its current location
(on country basis) can be retrieved depending on the provisioned service profile.

TECHNICAL REALISATION

The service (MSISDN Resolver Service) is built as a client/server achitecture based on the Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP), the client exchanges with the server XML-encapsulated data transfered via HTTP.

The MRS client submits a request to the server and in return receives the needed information or a exception if a failure
or error occurs.

The MRS server will process the query and try to lookup the subscriber via its direct SS7 access to MNOs
(Mobile Network Operator) worldwide. If the subscriber does exist the MRS server will send the data back to the
client or an exception if the subscriber is unknown or not reachable for other reasons.
